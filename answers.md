- **2)** Work: W(n)=W(n-1)+W(n-2) O(2^n)

- **3)**S(n)=S9n-1)+1Span: O(n)

- **4)**The counts list follows the fibonachi sequence. The rate of growth of counts corresponds roughly to the sequence. The number of times that each fibonachi number when calculated for depends on the calculates of the preceding numbers. As "n" increases, so does the number of times the fibonachi number is calculated.

- **6)** Max amount of calls is n. W=O(n) S=O(n)

- **8)** The max amount of calls to F_i is n-2 W=O(n) S=O(n)
